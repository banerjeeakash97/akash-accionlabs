# Accionlabs DevOps Test

1. [Dockerfile for nginx 1.19](./Dockerfile)
Write a Dockerfile to run nginx version 1.19 in a container. Choose a base image, considering security best
practices, and aim for the image to pass a container image security test


2. [Kubernetes StatefulSet](./nginx-statefulset.yaml)
Write a Kubernetes StatefulSet to deploy the nginx container from the previous question. Utilize persistent
volume claims and define resource limits for optimal performance.


3. [Build a Deployment Pipeline](./.github/workflows/deploy-nginx.yaml)
Set up a streamlined build and deployment pipeline for the nginx application using GitHub Actions or an
equivalent CI/CD tool. Ensure the pipeline covers building the Docker image, running security checks, and
deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.


4. [Text Manipulation Problem](./Text_Manipulation_Problem.md)
Choose or create a text manipulation problem that involves using awk, sed, tr, and/or grep. Solve the problem,
considering efficiency and readability.


5. [Text Manipulation with an Object Orientated Programming Language](./Text_Manipulation_with_Python.md)
Solve the text manipulation problem from the previous question using any Object Orientated Programming
language of your choice. Provide a clear and well-documented solution.


6. [Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers](./Sum_of_Even_Fibonacci_Numbers.md)
Write a program in a Object Orientated Programming language of your choice to calculate the sum of the first
100 even-valued Fibonacci numbers. Consider efficiency and demonstrate good coding practices.


7. [Intersection of Sorted Arrays](./Intersection_of_Sorted_Arrays.md)
Write a function in a Object Orientated Programming language of your choice that takes two sorted arrays of
integers as input and returns an array containing numbers common to both arrays without duplicates.


8. [Decimal Digit Transformation](./Decimal_Digit_Transformation.md)
Write a function in an Object Orientated Programming language of your choice that, when passed a decimal
digit X, calculates and returns the value of X + XX + XXX + XXXX. For example, if X is 3, the function should return
3702 (3 + 33 + 333 + 3333). Ensure the function handles valid inputs and provides meaningful error messages for
invalid inputs.
