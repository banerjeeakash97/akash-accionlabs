## **Sum of Even Fibonacci Numbers**

### **Approach for Efficiency**  
1. **Even Fibonacci Property**: Every third Fibonacci number is even (i.e., \(F_3, F_6, F_9, \dots\)).  
2. **Optimized Calculation**: Instead of generating the entire sequence and filtering even numbers, we directly generate even Fibonacci numbers using the recurrence relation:  
   \[
   E_n = 4E_{n-1} + E_{n-2}
   \]
   where:
   - \( E_1 = 2 \)
   - \( E_2 = 8 \)
   - \( E_n = 4E_{n-1} + E_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 3 \).

### **Python Solution**
```python
class EvenFibonacciSum:
    def __init__(self, count):
        """Initialize the count of even Fibonacci numbers to sum."""
        self.count = count

    def calculate_sum(self):
        """Calculates the sum of the first `count` even Fibonacci numbers efficiently."""
        even_fib1, even_fib2 = 2, 8  # First two even Fibonacci numbers
        total_sum = even_fib1 + even_fib2
        count = 2  # We have already counted two numbers

        while count < self.count:
            next_even_fib = 4 * even_fib2 + even_fib1
            total_sum += next_even_fib
            even_fib1, even_fib2 = even_fib2, next_even_fib
            count += 1

        return total_sum

fib_sum_calculator = EvenFibonacciSum(100)
result = fib_sum_calculator.calculate_sum()
print("Sum of the first 100 even Fibonacci numbers:", result)
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Encapsulation**:  
   - The class `EvenFibonacciSum` encapsulates the Fibonacci calculation logic.  
2. **Constructor (`__init__`)**:  
   - Takes `count` as input (how many even Fibonacci numbers to sum).  
3. **Method `calculate_sum`**:  
   - Uses an **efficient recurrence relation** to directly generate even Fibonacci numbers without iterating through all Fibonacci numbers.  
   - Updates the sequence iteratively in constant space \( O(1) \).  
   - Uses a `while` loop to generate and sum the first `100` even Fibonacci numbers.
